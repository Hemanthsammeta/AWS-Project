# CPU Utilization Monitoring on AWS using CloudWatch

This project demonstrates how to monitor CPU utilization of EC2 instances on **AWS** using **Amazon CloudWatch**. It provides a step-by-step guide to set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor CPU usage and send notifications when certain thresholds are met.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of CPU utilization on AWS EC2 instances.
- Set up custom CloudWatch alarms to trigger when CPU usage exceeds defined thresholds.
- Automatic notifications via Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) when alarms are triggered.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project involves:
1. **Amazon EC2** instances: These are the virtual servers where your applications run.
2. **Amazon CloudWatch**: A monitoring service that tracks CPU utilization and other performance metrics.
3. **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, etc.) when CloudWatch alarms are triggered.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- An active **AWS account**.
- At least one **EC2 instance** running in your AWS environment.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services, especially **EC2**, **CloudWatch**, and **SNS**.

## Installation

1. **Set up EC2 instances**:
   - Launch EC2 instances from the AWS Management Console.
   - Ensure they have the necessary permissions (CloudWatch permissions are required).

2. **Install AWS CLI** (optional):
   You can also configure and monitor resources using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Install it by following the official AWS CLI installation guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

3. **Configure AWS CLI** (if using CLI):

## Setup
Step 1: Create a CloudWatch Alarm for CPU Utilization
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to CloudWatch.
Click on Alarms â†’ Create Alarm.
Select the EC2 instance(s) you want to monitor.
Choose CPU Utilization as the metric and set a threshold (e.g., greater than 80%).
Configure Actions to send notifications via SNS when the alarm is triggered.
Review and create the alarm.
Step 2: Set Up Amazon SNS for Notifications
Go to the SNS dashboard.
Create a new topic (e.g., CPUAlerts).
Subscribe to the topic with your email address or phone number.
Associate the SNS topic with your CloudWatch alarm.
Step 3: Testing the Setup
.Trigger the Alarm: Run a CPU-intensive task on your EC2 instance to test the alarm.
.Receive Notifications: When the CPU utilization exceeds the threshold, CloudWatch will trigger the alarm, and you will receive a notification via SNS.


## Usage
Monitoring: The CPU utilization metrics can be viewed in real-time from the CloudWatch dashboard.
Alarms: Alarms will trigger notifications when the CPU usage exceeds the configured threshold, allowing you to take immediate action.
Notifications: SNS will send an email or SMS notification to the specified recipient when alarms are activated.
